Nirmaan. The name speaks for itself- an amalgamation of hard work, sweat, tears, and smiles. Established in 2005 by a group of students in Pilani, Nirmaan has come a long way. Today it has touched the lives of Children, Women, Youth, and Farmers from diverse social backgrounds across Pilani, channeled with a single motivation- ‘We have one passion, the rise of a great nation’.
  
Throughout its 17 year journey, we at Nirmaan have had a constant goal- bringing smiles upon faces. The idea of serving the underprivileged has been the source of strength which has ultimately led the tree named ‘Nirmaan’ to blossom, and it is only growing with each passing day. With 11 projects as its branches, currently working in different domains such as Education, Women Empowerment and Employment, we all have the same goal- to provide shelter and help to those in need, whether it is in the form of education, financial support or making them self-reliant. Our efforts came to fruition as we recently achieved the milestone of impacting 1 million lives, which has only motivated us to spread our reach. Where people hesitate to tread their steps towards service, a group of students from BITS Pilani have initiated the voluntary efforts to serve the needy people from the lower strata.
